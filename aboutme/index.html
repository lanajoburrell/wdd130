  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Lana Burrell and I am from Idaho! I am currently majoring in small business and entrepreneurship. I have a small soap business with my sister and that is what I want to do for my career. I am taking this class so that I can develop my own website for my business and become more comfortable working with technology.  </p>
<p>I love doing things outside and spending time on our family farm. I love Jesus Christ and His restored church! I look forward to this semester and learning more with all of you in this class!</p>
